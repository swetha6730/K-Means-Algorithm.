# K-Means-Algorithm.
# PROJECT TITLE: 
 Analysis and predection of"Mallcustomers.csv" of american mall markets called as phonix Mall to find out how many customers are visited to a particular a shop on the basis of these predection of anual income vas spending score
# DISCLIMER:
 In this particular dataset we assume annual income as a centroide and spending score from the range 1 to 100 calld as datanodes of the clusters.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
 The American finance market as per the GDPof 2011 "phonex_trillums" Mall as in the first range out of five.The owner of the Mall wants to be exact which particular shop or product search in different kinds of clusters in entire Mall
 As a Data Science engineer predict the futuristic finanical market for upcoming GDP rate based on number of clusters
 The client want atleast five top clusters(shops).

# CONCLUSION: 
 According to the model basics predections using machine learning alogorithm kmeans clusytering we found that clusters were which consist red color is a highest cluster which attach more than 50 datanodes.
